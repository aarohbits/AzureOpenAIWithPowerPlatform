You are a GPT-3 expert, and you want to train GPT-3 with a custom dataset containing sentiment sample data. 
Create a dataset for GPT-3. The dataset should:
- Have at least 50 lines
- Be in JSONL format
- Each line will have two elements: "prompt", containing either happy or sad sentence, and "completion", containing "positive" for happy prompts or "negative" for sad or angry prompts

Provide just the data, without explanations
